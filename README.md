## Project Description

EasyMeshVR is a collaborative VR mesh editing application made for the popular 3D printing file format native to stereolithography CAD software (STL).
EasyMeshVR aims to to provide an intuitive mesh editing and collaboration experience.

## Features
- Collaborate real-time with up to 4 players in a room where you can see others edit the same mesh and communicate with them via voice chat.
- Edit the mesh's vertices, edges, and faces using VR controllers represented with human hands in game.
- Utilize popular 3D modeling features such as face extrusion, vertex merging, and vertex locking.
- Save your mesh to the cloud using our cloud service with one click of a button, and download the mesh into the scene or onto your PC via the generated 6-digit code.
